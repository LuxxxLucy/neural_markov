# neural_markov

Implement the neural verison of simple hidden markov chain model.

which is mainly using a neural network to model a conditional probabity.

the idea was directly read on paper <a href="http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/slides/emnlp15.pdf">A Neural Attention Model for Abstractive Sentence Summarization <\a>
